For this project several python libraries were used, namely matplotlib, pandas, numpy, seaborn and plotly. The ipynb file was created locally in Jupyter Lab in a Linux distribution, using a python virtual environment (created with virtualenv), and the necessary packages were installed using pip within said virtual environment.
The csv data file was provided by Oeson.
